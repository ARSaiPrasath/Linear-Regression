# Linear-Regression for Salary data
This is a simple linear regression for salary data. First we are, plotting a graph to explain the values how they are scattered. 
Secondly, we are training and testing the data. After that we are performming linear regression and then we are predicting the salary. Thirdly, we plot a graph between actual and predicted values, and plotting the error. Next step is to calculate mean square error and R square value. After that, plot actual and predicted values for more insights. Finally, we calculate the intercept of the model and coefficient of the line.
